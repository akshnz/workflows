> Starter workflows allow everyone in your organization who has permission to
> create workflows to do so more quickly and easily. When you create a new
> workflow, you can choose a starter workflow and some or all of the work of
> writing the workflow will be done for you. You can use starter workflows as a
> starting place to build your custom workflow or use them as-is. This not only
> saves time, it promotes consistency and best practice across your
> organization.
